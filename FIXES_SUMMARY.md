# StashMate App Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Welcome Page (index.tsx) Not Appearing Before Sign Page

**Problem**: The welcome page wasn't showing before the login page due to navigation logic redirecting users directly to `/login`.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `app/_layout.tsx` to modify the navigation logic
- Added proper handling for the welcome page route
- Added the `index` screen to the Stack navigator
- Modified the `useEffect` to check if user is on welcome page before redirecting

**Files Modified**:
- `app/_layout.tsx`

### 2. Missing Welcome Message After User Sign-In

**Problem**: No welcome message was displayed after users successfully signed in.

**Solution**:
- Added a beautiful animated welcome message overlay to the dashboard
- Implemented time-based greeting (Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening)
- Added user name extraction from displayName or email
- Used React Native Reanimated for smooth animations
- Implemented AsyncStorage to track if welcome message has been shown
- Welcome message auto-hides after 3 seconds

**Features Added**:
- Animated welcome overlay with fade and scale effects
- Personalized greeting based on time of day
- User name display
- Checkmark icon for successful sign-in
- Proper styling with theme colors

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx`

### 3. Reports Page Progress Chart Not Working

**Problem**: The reports page was missing a "progress" chart type functionality.

**Solution**:
- Added a new `ChartType` type with 'trend', 'savings', and 'progress' options
- Implemented a progress chart using `ProgressChart` from react-native-chart-kit
- Added chart type selector buttons in the UI
- Created `progressChartData()` function to calculate savings goal progress
- Added proper color coding and legend for multiple accounts
- Implemented proper data processing for vault progress calculation

**Features Added**:
- Progress chart showing savings goals completion percentage
- Chart type selector (Trend, Savings, Progress)
- Color-coded progress indicators
- Account-specific progress tracking
- Proper empty state handling

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/reports.tsx`
