# Net Balance Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Net Balance feature provides users with a comprehensive view of their financial standing by calculating their total net balance across all linked accounts and transactions. This feature implements sophisticated logic to handle various financial scenarios including negative balances, pending transactions, and existing account balances.

## Core Logic

### Net Balance Formula

```
Net Balance = Initial Account Balances + Total Income - Total Expenses
```

Where:
- **Initial Account Balances**: The sum of all linked account balances when they were first connected
- **Total Income**: Sum of all income transactions from linked accounts
- **Total Expenses**: Sum of all expense transactions from linked accounts

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Calculation**: Net balance is calculated dynamically based on current data
2. **Multi-account Support**: Aggregates data from all linked financial accounts
3. **Transaction Status Filtering**: Excludes pending/future transactions by default
4. **Negative Balance Handling**: Provides clear visual indicators and warnings for negative balances
5. **Detailed Breakdown**: Shows component parts of the calculation for transparency

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates

#### Transaction Status Field
Added `status` field to transactions with three possible values:
- `completed`: Transaction has been processed (default for past/current dates)
- `pending`: Transaction is waiting for processing
- `scheduled`: Transaction is planned for future execution

#### Enhanced Transaction Interface
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  amount: number;
  category: string;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
  date: Timestamp;
  status?: 'completed' | 'pending' | 'scheduled';
  paymentMethod?: string;
}
```

### Core Functions

#### `calculateNetBalance(userId: string, includePending: boolean = false)`

**Purpose**: Calculates comprehensive net balance for a user

**Parameters**:
- `userId`: User identifier
- `includePending`: Whether to include pending/scheduled transactions (default: false)

**Returns**:
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  netBalance?: number;
  breakdown?: {
    totalAccountBalance: number;
    totalIncome: number;
    totalExpenses: number;
    isNegative: boolean;
    accountBalances: Array<{accountName: string, balance: number, institution: string}>;
    transactionCounts: {
      income: number;
      expenses: number;
      total: number;
    };
  };
  error?: string;
}
```

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- No linked accounts (returns zero balance)
- Invalid transaction amounts (skipped from calculation)
- Missing transaction types (categorized as unknown)
- Database connection issues (returns error with fallback)

#### `formatBalance(balance: number, showCurrency: boolean = true)`

**Purpose**: Formats balance values with proper negative handling

**Features**:
- Handles negative numbers with proper minus sign placement
- Thousand separators for readability
- Consistent decimal places (2)
- Optional currency symbol

**Examples**:
```typescript
formatBalance(1234.56)     // "$1,234.56"
formatBalance(-1234.56)    // "-$1,234.56"
formatBalance(1234.56, false) // "1,234.56"
```

#### `getNetBalanceStatus(netBalance: number)`

**Purpose**: Provides contextual status information for net balance

**Returns**:
```typescript
{
  status: 'positive' | 'negative' | 'neutral';
  message: string;
  color: string;
  icon: string;
}
```

**Status Categories**:
- **Positive**: Balance > 0 (Green, trending-up icon)
- **Negative**: Balance < 0 (Red, trending-down icon)
- **Neutral**: Balance = 0 (Orange, remove icon)

### UI Implementation

#### Dashboard Net Balance Card

**Features**:
- Real-time balance display with status indicators
- Toggle for including/excluding pending transactions
- Detailed breakdown showing:
  - Initial account balances
  - Total income
  - Total expenses
  - Warning messages for negative balances

**Visual Indicators**:
- Color-coded balance based on status (green/red/orange)
- Icons representing trend direction
- Loading states during calculation
- Warning messages for negative balances

#### Toggle Controls

**Current vs All Transactions**:
- **Current**: Shows only completed transactions (default)
- **All**: Includes pending and scheduled transactions

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const [includePendingTransactions, setIncludePendingTransactions] = useState(false);
```

## Edge Case Handling

### 1. Negative Net Balances

**Scenario**: When total expenses exceed income and initial balance

**Handling**:
- Visual warning with red color scheme
- Clear explanatory message
- Prominent warning icon
- Detailed breakdown to help user understand the deficit

**Example Warning**: "⚠️ You have more expenses than income and initial balance"

### 2. Pending/Future Transactions

**Scenario**: Transactions scheduled for future dates or pending processing

**Handling**:
- Excluded from default calculation to show current financial position
- Optional inclusion via toggle switch
- Clear status indicators in transaction lists
- Separate tracking for different transaction statuses

### 3. Pre-existing Account Balances

**Scenario**: User already has money in accounts when linking to app

**Handling**:
- Initial account balance is preserved and included in net balance calculation
- Account balances are stored when accounts are first linked
- Balance acts as starting point for net worth calculation
- Clear breakdown shows contribution of initial balances vs. transactions

**Formula Application**:
```
If user had $5,000 in account initially:
+ $5,000 (initial balance)
+ $2,000 (income transactions)
- $1,500 (expense transactions)
= $5,500 (net balance)
```

### 4. Multiple Account Management

**Scenario**: User has multiple linked accounts with different balances

**Handling**:
- Aggregates all account balances
- Shows breakdown by account and institution
- Maintains account-specific balance tracking
- Provides consolidated view across all accounts

### 5. Data Consistency and Error Handling

**Scenarios**:
- Database connection failures
- Malformed transaction data
- Missing account information
- Concurrent data updates

**Handling**:
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Fallback to cached data when possible
- Clear loading states during calculations
- Retry mechanisms for temporary failures

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Batch Queries**: Single query for all user transactions
